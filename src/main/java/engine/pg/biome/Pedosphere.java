/*

    Forest Pedosphere: Found in forests, characterized by a mix of organic matter from decaying leaves, twigs, and other plant materials, along with mineral components.

    Desert Pedosphere: In arid regions, the pedosphere may be sandy and lacking in organic matter, with less developed soil profiles due to minimal precipitation and biological activity.

    Grassland Pedosphere: In grassland biomes, the soil often contains a significant amount of organic matter from grass roots, contributing to its fertility.

    Tundra Pedosphere: In cold, northern regions, the pedosphere may be frozen (permafrost), limiting soil development and organic decomposition.

    Wetland Pedosphere: In areas like marshes, swamps, and bogs, the pedosphere is often waterlogged, leading to unique soil characteristics influenced by anaerobic conditions.

    Mountainous Pedosphere: In mountainous regions, the soil profile may vary significantly based on altitude, slope, and local geology, leading to diverse pedospheric characteristics.

    Agricultural Pedosphere: Soils that have been cultivated for agriculture may have distinct characteristics based on farming practices, irrigation, and fertilization, influencing soil structure and fertility.
